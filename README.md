# ReactJS TodoList

A to-do list app built with ReactJS using the Vite build tool. This app allows the user to view their to-dos in a list. Users can add, update, and delete their to-dos in the list using an intuitive user interface.

Future updates to include allowing the user to mark completed to-dos as completed, vs incomplete to-dos. The user will be able to view their incomplete to-dos apart from their completed ones. Completed to-dos are removed from the list of incomplete to-dos.

Future update to include a much more comprehensive README as well ;)
